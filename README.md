## 📖 Creating New Topics

### Using the `/education` Command

The `/education` command automates the process of creating new educational topics:

1. **Summarize**: The command summarizes the topic from your conversation
2. **Create Files**: Generates markdown files and related resources
3. **Organize**: Places content in the appropriate location (main repo or Random folder)
4. **Git Workflow**: Creates branch, commits, pushes, and opens a PR automatically

**Note**: The `/education` command only works in the `continuous-software-education` repository for safety.

### Manual Creation

If you prefer to create topics manually:

1. Create a new folder with a descriptive name (kebab-case)
2. Add a `README.md` with topic overview
3. Organize content into guides, examples, and resources
4. Update this main README with a link to your topic
5. Follow the structure of existing topics for consistency

## 📁 Topic Structure Guidelines

Each topic should follow a consistent structure:

```
topic-name/
├── README.md              # Overview and navigation
├── guides/                # Structured learning modules (optional)
├── examples/              # Code examples (optional)
├── diagrams/              # Visual aids (optional)
└── resources/             # Additional resources (optional)
